# README: Preferential Binding Coefficient Calculation

## Overview
This program calculates the preferential binding coefficient using Equation 56 from the following reference:
> DOI: [10.1007/s12013-007-9005-0](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12013-007-9005-0)

The program is written in Fortran and utilizes the cumulative number (-cn) obtained from `gmx rdf` using GROMACS 2021.4.

## Input Files
The program requires two input files in '.xvg' format:
1. cn_crowder.xvg – Cumulative number of the crowder molecules.
2. cn_water.xvg – Cumulative number of water molecules.

These files should be located in the same directory as the executable.

## Compilation & Execution
Ensure you have 'gfortran' installed before compiling the program.

### Compilation:

 gfortran pfc.f90 


### Running the Program:

 ./a.out


## Output
The program generates an output file named:
- output_pref_binding.txt  – Contains the calculated preferential binding coefficient values.

## Dependencies
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- gfortran (Fortran compiler)
- GROMACS 2021.4 (or any other version) (for generating input files using 'gmx rdf -cn')

## Notes
- Ensure that the input files are formatted correctly in '.xvg' format.
- Modify the Fortran source code if necessary to adjust file paths or calculation parameters.

For any issues or questions, refer to the cited reference or documentation of 'gmx rdf'. Happy computing!
