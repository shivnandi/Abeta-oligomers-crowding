# README for secondary_structure.f90

## Reference
This program evaluates secondary structure data obtained using the STRIDE algorithm in VMD.
For details on STRIDE, refer to the VMD manual


## Description
This Fortran 90 program processes the output data obtained from VMD after running the STRIDE algorithm. It categorizes the secondary structures into:
- Coil: Output files `fort.11`, `fort.12`, ..., corresponding to the number of protein chains.
- Turn: Output files `fort.21`, `fort.22`, ...
- Beta Sheet: Output files `fort.31`, `fort.32`, ...
- Alpha Helix: Output files `fort.41`, `fort.42`, ...

Additional secondary structure classifications can be modified within the program.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile the code using 'gfortran':

gfortran secondary_structure.f90 -o secondary_structure


To run the compiled program:

    ./secondary_structure


The input data file should be named 'ss.txt' and should be present in the same directory as the executable. You can change that in code also.

## Output
The program generates multiple output files ('fort.*'), where each file corresponds to a different secondary structure type for each protein chain. If you have four protein chains, the following files will be created:

- Coil : 'fort.11', 'fort.12', 'fort.13', 'fort.14'
- Turn: 'fort.21', 'fort.22', 'fort.23', 'fort.24'
- Beta Sheet: 'fort.31', 'fort.32', 'fort.33', 'fort.34'
- Alpha Helix: 'fort.41', 'fort.42', 'fort.43', 'fort.44'
- You can take the average and fraction of secondary structure later.

Other secondary structure types can be added or modified in the Fortran code as needed.

## Notes
- Ensure 'ss.txt' is formatted correctly with secondary structure data from VMD.
- Modify the code as required to process additional secondary structure classifications.
- The output file naming convention follows the pattern 'fort.XY', where:
  - 'X' indicates the secondary structure type (1 = Coil, 2 = Turn, 3 = Beta Sheet, 4 = Alpha Helix).
  - 'Y' represents the protein chain index.


For further modifications, refer to the VMD STRIDE documentation and adjust the Fortran logic accordingly.
