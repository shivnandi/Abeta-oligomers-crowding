# README for MSD Calculation Code

## Description
This Fortran program calculates the Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) of water molecules in a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. The code processes coordinate data of oxygen atoms from water molecules across multiple frames and computes the MSD.

## Variables to Modify
- num_mol : Number of water molecules in the system.
- num_frames : Number of frames to process.

## Input File
The input file should contain the coordinates of oxygen atoms of water molecules at each frame. The default input file name is 'all_oxygen.gro' created using GROMACS 2021.4 software, but this can be changed in the code if necessary.

## Output File
The calculated MSD data will be written to 'fort.500'.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile the code using 'gfortran':

    gfortran msd.final -o msd_final


To run the compiled program:

    ./msd_final


Ensure that the input file 'all_oxygen.gro' is in the same directory before execution.

## Notes
- Modify 'num_mol' and 'num_frames' within the Fortran code as needed.
- Ensure that the '.gro' file is correctly formatted with oxygen atom coordinates for accurate MSD computation.
- The output file 'fort.500' will contain the computed MSD values.

For further modifications, adjust the Fortran logic accordingly.
